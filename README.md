# snakeGame
In this project I'm (following a tutorial) trying my best to recreate an old mobilephone game, namely "the snake". This project uses the **p5.js** framework.


**Note**: Keep the project file structure



You can preview this project [here](https://fipie.github.io/snakeGame/) (when it's ready of course;)
